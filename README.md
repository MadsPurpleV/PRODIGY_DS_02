# Task-2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## Project Description
Analyzed the Titanic dataset by cleaning missing values and exploring key features. Conducted EDA to identify trends and relationships affecting passenger survival, and presented findings through clear visualizations for better interpretation.

This project performs **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset.

It is part of my **Prodigy Internship Data Science Task-1**.

## Insights
- Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.  
- Passengers in **1st class** survived more than those in 2nd or 3rd class.  
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.  
- `Sex` and `Pclass` were the strongest predictors of survival.
